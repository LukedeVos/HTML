<h1>The Ring Video Doorbell</h1>
<p>Imagine the perfect front door. Like a human security guard, it would tell you who was outside and allow you to talk with them before you let them in. The $200 Ring Video Doorbell system does just that: it’s a small ringer with a camera that communicates with your phone, allowing you to see who is outside before you let them in. You can then talk to them as you politely deny them entry, or call out a more civilized “coming!”</p>
