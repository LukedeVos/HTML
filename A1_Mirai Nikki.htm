Everything written in that entry happens exactly like it's written down and Yukiteru realises that he has can now look into the future. His life has been simplified and he abuses his diary, but he soon learns that he is not the only diary owner. He alongside 11 others have been selected to enter the survival game, made by Deus Ex Machina, the god of the world that wasn't very imaginative after all.
