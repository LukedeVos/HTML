<p>Ghouls are humans who cannot digest anything else but human meat. They are strong and feared, but keep their identities secret. Kaneki is just a normal human, minding his own business, until he gets attacked by a ghoul, but survives and the ghoul is killed. In order for him to live, they, unknowingly, transport the organs of the attacker in him. But this made Kaneki a ghoul himself. He needs to adept, he needs to learn to kill, but will he be able to put up with the pressure? Will he be able to keep himself hidden from his friends, and more importantly, his enemy's?</p>
