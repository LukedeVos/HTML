<p><strong>Our goal</strong></p>
<p>Our goal is to bring you the best top 10's of them all! Of course we can't bring you the best of everything, even we have our limits, but we try our best to give you up-to-date information about your favorite genre! And that was the soul purpose of this website, to help others find something they might like, or get some thought going, for why a particulair thing is not in our top 10!</p>
<p><strong>A little bit about ourselves</strong></p>
<p>We are two boys from the Netherlands, who enjoy programming, to make it easy for you, here's a quick and easy table to show you some things about us:</p>
<table class="center">
<tr>
	<td><strong>Name</strong></td>
	<td><strong>age</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Hobby</strong></td>
	<td><strong>Favorite kind of pie</strong></td>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td>Luke</td>
	<td>17</td>
	<td>Games, Programming, Programming Games</td>
	<td>Apple pie</p>
</tr>
<tr>
	<td  onmouseover="this.innerHTML='Richard'" onmouseout="this.innerHTML='Yorick'">Yorick</td><!--dit is HTML5-->
	<td>16</td>
	<td>Tennis, Karate</td>
	<td  onmouseover="this.innerHTML='The pie is a lie'" onmouseout="this.innerHTML='Any pie'">Any pie</td><!--haal het deel van onmouseover en onmouseout maar weg als je t niet leuk vind, ik vind t wel geinig-->
</tr>n
</table>
