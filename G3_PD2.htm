  <h1>Payday 2</h1>
  <p>Payday 2 is a cooperative first-person shooter video game developed by Overkill Software and published by 505 Games. The game is a sequel to 2011's Payday: The Heist. It was released on 13 August 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. An improved version of the game, subtitled Crimewave Edition, was released for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One in June 2015 (on 12 June in the UK and Europe and on 16 June in North America).

Two years after the events of the previous game, a new gang comes to the Washington, D.C. area to rob banks. The player takes control of one of the gang's twelve members and heists alone, with up to two AI players, as four player cooperative play, or some combination of the previous. Heists include robbing banks, jewellery stores, and armored cars, producing and distributing narcotics, stealing prototypes, art and artifact theft, rigging elections and framing corrupt politicians, taking on rival gangs, breaking into mercenary bases, prisons, and FBI facilities, enforcing protection rackets, and smuggling of guns and nuclear warheads. The game differs on the previous by allowing much more customization of the player and reworking its stealth mechanics.

An accompanying web series was produced to promote the game. The game was profitable from pre-orders alone and received positive reviews. Payday 2: Crimewave Edition which offers improved graphics, new content and all previous DLCs, was released on June 12, 2015 for PlayStation 4 and Xbox One.</p>
